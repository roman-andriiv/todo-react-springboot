### "ToDo" web-application

Fullstack project with React JS and Spring Boot.<br> 
Create, update or delete your ToDo's


This project contains links to 2 repositories:

* React JS framework for client side [[FRONTEND]](https://github.com/roman-andriiv/todo-react);
* Java and Spring Boot to build server side for app [[BACKEND]](https://github.com/roman-andriiv/todo-springboot);

I developed this project as part of a course [Master Spring Boot 3 & Spring Framework 6 with Java](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-and-spring-framework-tutorial-for-beginners/)
